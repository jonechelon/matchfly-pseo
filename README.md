## 🇬🇧 English

MatchFly aggregates flight data (delays and cancellations) from Guarulhos Airport (GRU), generates SEO-optimized static pages, and informs passengers about compensation rights (ANAC 400 / EC 261), with integration to compensation verification partners.

---

## About

MatchFly is an automated platform that:

- Consolidates flight data (scrapers, CSV, ANAC data)
- Generates a static site with one page per problematic flight and per destination
- Provides a clear interface for status queries and links for compensation verification

The site is published on **GitHub Pages** from the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch.

---

## UI: Split-Flap (Retro Airport)

The interface uses a **Split-Flap** visual concept (retro airport-style panels): cards by city with delayed/cancelled flights, tab navigation (Cities, Cancelled, Delayed), and a custom 404 page. The layout is responsive (Tailwind CSS) and accessible.

## How to run

**Prerequisite:** have data in `data/flights-db.json` (generated by `voos_proximos_finalbuild.py` or historical import).

Generate the site locally (output in `docs/`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/generator.py
```

Open in browser: `docs/index.html` or serve the `docs/` folder with a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server --directory docs 8000`).

To update data before generating:

```bash
python voos_proximos_finalbuild.py
python src/generator.py
```

Complete pipeline (scraper + generator): `./scripts/run_pipeline.sh` (run from repository root).
